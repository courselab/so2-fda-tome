 Tyos32 - Tiny OS 32-bit version.
 ==============================================

 This is a very simple code example to demonstrate the procedure to switch from
 real to protected mode. First stage, the boot loader, fits entirely within
 the 512-byte master boot record of a USB stick. It is meant to be loaded
 through legacy BIOS boot method and execute in real mode on any x86 platform.
 When loaded, the 512-byte bootloader loads the second stage and calls
 the function init(), expected to be implemented by the latter program.
 The second stage perform all the steps to switch to 32-bit protected mode.

 

 Instructions
 ------------------------------

 The code examples in this directory include explanatory comments annotated
 directly in the source file comments. Those notes are complemented by the
 additional technical discussions provided in this README file.
 
 While some examples may be independent one from another, there may be also
 sequences of code snippets in which each example builds on its predecessor.
 In those cases, it may be interesting to go through the code examples in the
 same order they are introduced in the present README.
 
 For convenience, a build script (e.g. Makefile) may be provided which contains
 rules to compile, execute and inspect the contents of the source and object
 the examples are built and executed.


 Contents
 ------------------------------

 * rt0.S	startup file (runtime initialization).
 * bootloader.c	the first stage of the boot sequence.
 * utils.c	handy functions to be used by the bootloader.
 * init32.S	prepare GTD and switch to 32-bit protected mode.
 * kernel.c	the second stage of the boot sequence.
 * boot.ld	the linker script used to build the binary.
  
 To experiment with the code example, try:

    make boot.bin

 This should build the objects and linke them to form boot.bin.

 The linker script makes sure that a boot signature is written at end of the
 first 512-byte block, after rt0 and bootloader, and that the kernel is written
 at the beginning of the next block.

 Test the boot image with

   make boot.bin/run

 If everything is ok, you should see a message by the bootloader and another
 message by the loaded kernel.

 To test with the physical hardware, you can write boot.bin directly into
 a USB stick and then boot using it.

 Alternatively, you can create a FAT12-formatted 1.44 MB floppy disk image with

   make boot.img

 You can either boot boot.img with the emulator

   make boot.img/run

 or write the image into the USB sitck and boot it on the physical hardware

   dd if=boot.img of=<your-usb-device>

 The program source code is extensively commented and contains detailed
 information on how the program works. In special, rt0.S and boot.ld have some
 in-depth technical notes on the hardware and the build tools.
 


 
  Good coding.
 


 APPENDIX A: SYSeg conventions.
 ----------------------------------
 


 Bintools: convenience rules for inspecting binary files
 ------------------------------------------------------------
 
 SYSeg's Bintools is a collection of Makefile rules aimed as shortcut for
 invoking binary inspection utilities. It contains handy Make rules for
 disassembling objects, comparing files, creating bootable images, invoking
 platform emulators and other facilities. Some shortcuts are ad hoc rules
 crafted under poetic license and may depart from conventional Make usage.

 CONVENTIONS
 
 As a rule of thumb, a file named

     foo.bar            contains the working implementation
     foo-beta.bar	contains working but cumbersome/inelegant implementation
     foo-alpha.bar	contains incomplete or wrong implementation

 File extensions:

   -`hex`  ASCII file containing values in hexadecimal representation;

   -`asm`  manually written assembly code in Intel ASM format;

   -`S`    manually written assembly code in AT&T Gas format;

   -`s`    assembly code in AT&T Gas format generated by the compiler (gcc);

   -`o`    object code produced by the assembler;

   -`i`    pre-processed source code generated by the pre-processor (CPP)

   -`bin`  flat-binary file generated by the linker;

   -`iso`  ISO9660 (ECMA-119) file system intended for optical disk media (CD) 

   -`ld`   linker script (ld).


 Some examples allow alternative build recipes which can be selected
 by passing the command-line variable 'ALT=<number>' to 'make'. See bellow.

 NEEDED SOFTWARE

 In order to experiment with the examples in this section, the following
 pieces of software may be needed. The list indicates the lowest versions
 against which the project has been tested. Using a more recent version should
 be ok, but it is not absolutely guaranteed that results won't exhibit minor
 variations. Feedback is always appreciated.

 If required for a particular example, it is safe to use

 - Linux         5.13.0         (any decent ditribution)
 - gcc 	     	 9.3.0	        (the GNU compiler)
 - GNU binutils  2.34		(GNU assembler, linker, disassembler etc.) 
 - nasm		 2.14.02	(NASM assembler)
 - qemu		 4.2.1		(most probably qemu-system-i386)
 - gcc-multilib  9.3.0		(to compile 32-bit code in a 64-bit platform)
 - xorriso	 1.5.2-1	(depending on your computer's BIOS)
 - hexdump	 POSIX.2	(binary editor)
 
 CONVENIENCE RULES 


 * For building and inspecting binaries, use

   make					     Build the default target.

   make foo				     Build foo.

   make diss IMG=foo 			     Disassemble foo.

   	     	     			     Optionally,

					        ASM  = intel | att  (default)
						BIT  =    16 | 32   (default)

   make dump IMG=foo			     Show the raw contents of foo.
   
   make      			             Build everything (or make all)

   make clean			             Undo make all

   make diff foo bar baz		     Show graphical diff between files

   	     	     			     ASM and BIT variables apply


  * If any example involves the manipulation of a bootable image, use
  

   make run IMG=foo	             	     Run foo in the emulator

   make stick IMG=foo DEVICE=/dev/sdX        make a bootable USB stick


   SHORTCUTS

   For further convenience, the build script offers some ad hoc shortcuts:
   

   make foo/diss | foo/d		     disassemble .text as 32-bit AT&T

   make foo/diss intel|att		     disassemble as 32-bit Intel or AT&T
   make foo/diss 16|32			     disassemble as 16-bit or 32-bit
   make foo/diss intel|att 16|32	     disassemble as Intel|AT&T 16|32 bit
   make foo/diss 16|32 intel|att	     disassemble as Intel|AT&T 16|32 bit

   make foo/i16	       			     disassemble as Intel 16-bit
   make foo/a16 | foo/16  		     disassemble as AT&T  16-bit
   make foo/a32	| foo/32 | foo/a     	     disassemble as AT&T  32-bit
   make foo/i32	         | foo/i	     disassemble as Intel 32-bit

   		   			     In all disassembly rules, a
					     trailing '*' means disassemble all
					     sections, e.g. foo/d* foo/16* ...

   make foo/hex | foo/raw | foo/dump	     show raw contents in hexadecimal

   make foo/run				     test foo (mbr) with the emulator
   make foo/fd				     test foo (floppy) with the emulator

   make diffi16 | di16 | i16 foo bar baz     make diff with ASM=intel BIT=16
   make diffi32 | di32 | i32 foo bar baz     make diff with ASM=intel BIT=32
   make diffa16 | da16 | a16 foo bar baz     make diff with ASM=att BIT=16
   make diffa32 | da32 | a32 foo bar baz     make diff with ASM=att BIT=32

   make foo/stick dev    	   	     make stick IMG=foo DEVICE=dev

   make foo/l	  			     open foo in 'less' program
