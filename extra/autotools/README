 Autotools by example
 ==============================

 This directory contains a series of code examples that illustrate the
 step-by-step configuration of the GNU Build System toolchain (aka
 Autotools) for building a simple C program.

 The sequence starts as simple as minimal Autootls configuration, which
 is then incrementally sophisticated to expore more advanced features.
 The examples are by no means exhaustive and do not necessarily reflect
 all the possible cenarios, experts' practices or deep hackery. As for
 that I may suggest some references 1-5 listed bellow.
